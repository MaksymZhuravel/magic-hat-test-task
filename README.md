# Hogwarts Sorting Magic Hat Mobile Application

Implement the mobile application based on React-Native for iOS & Android platforms that gives users the ability to guess the relationship between characters and Houses in a similar way to what Magic Hat did in Wizarding World.

## Requirements
1. It’s possible to use any state management approach.
2. It’s allowed to use any UI library/framework to style the application.
3. It’s recommended to follow the provided mockups or it’d be a plus to customize it due to your preferences and/or best UX/UI practices.
4. The codebase of this application should be uploaded to GitHub public repository with relevant README information.

## Statements
- The app consists of 3 screens: Home, List and Details.
- Display randomly selected personage on the Home screen (photo and full name of character).
- Load different personage by pull-to-refresh gesture on the Home screen.
- Allow to click the House buttons to guess the affiliation of this character.
- On every choice, recalculate total/success/failed affiliations and display numbers in the boxes at the top of the Home and List screens. 
- The “Reset” button should flush all previously guessed personages and make all total values equal to zero.
- On the List screen display previously guessed affiliations (successful and failed) and the amount of attempts for every character (until successfully guessed).
- By clicking on the Reload button against the particular character, load this character on the Home screen with the House buttons again.
- By clicking on the character item row on the List screen, open the Details screen. Display personage information only in case this personage has been guessed right.

## Assessment
- workability: how your application works;
- project structure: how you structure your files;
- code quality: how you write clean, readable code;
- knowledge of technologies and their ecosystem: how you compose and use packages together;
- it will be a plus if you configure and use ESlint in your project

## How to complete the task
- create a new public repo on GitHub;
- develop the application according to the requirements;
- if you don't see something in the design, you can implement this functionality in UI just with your vision and understanding;
- send us the link to your repo, attached screenshots and/or video demonstrations will be a plus.
